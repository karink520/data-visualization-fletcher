### A Tufts University DISC Workshop

Dr. Karin Knudson and Dr. Anna Haensch

## Description

In this 3-day workshop we'll learn how to use Python to create impactful data visualizations.  We'll discuss the fundamentals of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis with Python, we'll talk about the principles of effective data visualizations, and we'll explore the most common Python based tools in a data scientist's toolkit.  The workshop will include lots of hands-on tutorials and time to experiment.

## Organizers

Dr. Anna Haensch is a Senior Data Scientist in the Tufts Data Intensive Studies Center and has a PhD in mathematics.  Her research involves approaches of machine learning and Bayesian inference to understand complicated multi-tiered time series data. She is also interested in the ways that numerical and data literacy impact that way we produce and consume media.

Dr. Karin Knudson is a Senior Data Scientist in the Tufts Data Intensive Studies Center and has a PhD in mathematics.  Her research has involved the development and application of methods from machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and compressive sensing, particularly to neural data. She is interested in using approaches from data science to support scholarship across and between a range of disciplines, and is also interested in education for data science.
